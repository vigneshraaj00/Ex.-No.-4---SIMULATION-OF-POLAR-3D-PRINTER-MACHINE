## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT:
## OUTPUT:

Assembly of polar 3D printer:

Y-Axis Frame:

The base of the printer that supports the rest of the components

Z-Axis Frame :
This is the frame that holds the print head and moves it up and down along the vertical axis.

Smooth Rods :
The smooth rods that provide smooth and accurate movement of the Z-axis frame.

Motors :
provide the power to move the Z-axis frame and the print head.

Extruder Supporter :
The support structure that holds the extruder assembly.

Threaded Rod :
Threaded rod that provides the power to move the Z-axis frame up and down.

Y-Axis Frame :
The frame that moves the print head in the horizontal plane.

Motor with Gear :
provides the power to move the Y-axis frame

Motor-with-Pulley :
provides the power to move the Z-axis frame.

Gears :
Transfer power from the stepper motors to the threaded rod and the smooth rods.

Plate :
plate where the printed object is created.

Extruder :
melts and extrudes the filament to create the printed object.

Filament :
material that is used to create the printed object.
